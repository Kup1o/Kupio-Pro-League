# Kupio-Pro-League
## _The best plugin(I guess) for manage Counter-Strike: Global Offensive 5v5 match_

Kupio Pro League plugin was created the 20th of June 2020 for FUN.
Really, for fun.
I had some friendly team for playing Counter-Strike on every evening.
We had wondered about practice with other teams in skills in that game(omg).


## _But,_ 
>Since I do not really love playing computer games(FPS in first of all)
I have decided to post(I am crazy I know) my plugin that I spent about a year of my lifetime because I do not really need it more.









## ====== FEATURES ======
- Friendly admin panel
- Setup max team size in server.cfg
- Enjoy the cancellation of the need for a steam token
- English & Russian & Korean localisation
- Custom status in console
- Captain System
- Knife Round
- Restore Round From Admin Panel


## ====== INSTALLING ======
1. First of all, you should download [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive - Dedicated Server](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Dedicated_Servers)
2. Since you successfully downloaded and _updated_ your dedicated server, you need to install [Sourcemod](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php?branch=stable) with [Metamod](https://www.metamodsource.net/downloads.php?branch=stable)
    
    Success? Pretty cool! I believed in you with all my soul :) 
    Now we are going to install Kupio Pro League plugin

3. Copy plugin repository to your server directory
    *_For Example:_
        *```sh
        cd /home/server/csgo-dedicated-server/
        git clone https://github.com/Kup1o/Kupio-Pro-League/csgo/
        ```

_That's it!_
